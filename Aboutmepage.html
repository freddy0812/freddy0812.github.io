        <h3>When i was a 9th grader we made a rube goldberg project, and we made it from scratch which made me realize that my skills lied in making things from top to bottom. After High School i want to go to college and pursue a career as a civil engineer. I enjoy buildings things because it gives me a sense of control, meaning that i decided what to do with this structure.

One of my major accomplishments from high school were me passing all my classes. I have a few activities i have participated during high school, they were, gaming club, weight training, and a little bit of football and volleyball.

What i have learned about myself from my experiences is with perseverance you can achieve your accomplishments. I wasn't passing one of my classes and by persevering you can accomplish a lot. Iâ€™ve had a few jobs in the past and i have learn a lot about them. Such as being a responsible employee and having respect for others so you'll be respected yourself.

In conclusion, personal qualities, important achievements and work skills have helped me a lot and are still helping me how to be a better person as a whole. Thank you for taking your time and reading this and i invite you to check out the rest of my website.
